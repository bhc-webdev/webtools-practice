      <dt>This Page Content</dt>
      <dd>This is a sample page to demonstrate some of the concepts related to the assignments in the web development
        class. I acquired much of the information about my avatar from Wikipedia. All I had to do is copy, paste and
        clean up the odd notations. Wikipedia has a fair use policy allowing us to use their content. Thanks, Wikipedia.
      </dd>
      <dd>Your first pages in the class should only have HTML tags as instructed in the assignment. The goal is to begin
        with well-formed standards-compliant code. You should not add any images, CSS styles or JavaScript at this time.

      <dt>Your Pages</dt>
      <dd>The pages for your site should have content about your avatar. Each students needs to create their own unique
        site. Please do not copy/paste others' code without significant changes. It is allowed for you to use the sample
        code from the assignment instructor's notes to give you a start, but you must embellish the code and add content
        specific to your project. Simple copy/paste without significant changes will result in a diminished grade.</dd>

      <dt>The Easter Bunny</dt>
      <dd>The Easter Bunny (also called the Easter Rabbit or Easter Hare) is a folkloric figure and symbol of Easter,
        depicted as a rabbit—sometimes dressed with clothes—bringing Easter eggs. Originating among German Lutherans,
        the "Easter Hare" originally played the role of a judge, evaluating whether children were good or disobedient in
        behavior at the start of the season of Eastertide, similar to the "naughty or nice" list made by Santa Claus. As
        part of the legend, the creature carries colored eggs in its basket, as well as candy, and sometimes toys, to
        the homes of children. As such, the Easter Bunny again shows similarities to Santa (or the Christkind) and
        Christmas by bringing gifts to children on the night before a holiday. The custom was first mentioned in Georg
        Franck von Franckenau's De ovis paschalibus ('About Easter eggs') in 1682, referring to a German tradition of an
        Easter Hare bringing eggs for the children.</dd>

      <dt>Rabbits and Hares</dt>
      <dd>The hare was a popular motif in medieval church art. In ancient times, it was widely believed (as by Pliny,
        Plutarch, Philostratus, and Aelian) that the hare was a hermaphrodite. The idea that a hare could reproduce
        without loss of virginity led to an association with the Virgin Mary, with hares sometimes occurring in
        illuminated manuscripts and Northern European paintings of the Virgin and Christ Child. It may also have been
        associated with the Holy Trinity, as in the three hares motif.</dd>

      <dt>Eggs</dt>
      <dd>Eggs have been used as fertility symbols since antiquity. Eggs became a symbol in Christianity associated with
        rebirth as early as the 1st century AD, via the iconography of the Phoenix egg, and they became associated with
        Easter specifically in medieval Europe, when eating them was prohibited during the fast of Lent. A common
        practice in England at that time was for children to go door-to-door begging for eggs on the Saturday before
        Lent began. People handed out eggs as special treats for children prior to their fast.</dd>
      <dd>As a special dish, eggs would probably have been decorated as part of the Easter celebrations. Later, German
        Protestants retained the custom of eating colored eggs for Easter, though they did not continue the tradition of
        fasting. Eggs boiled with some flowers change their color, bringing the spring into the homes, and some over
        time added the custom of decorating the eggs. Many Christians of the Eastern Orthodox Church to this day
        typically dye their Easter eggs red, the color of blood, in recognition of the blood of the sacrificed Christ
        (and, of the renewal of life in springtime). Some also use the color green, in honor of the new foliage emerging
        after the long-dead time of winter. The Ukrainian art of decorating eggs for Easter, known as pysanky, dates to
        ancient, pre-Christian times. Similar variants of this form of artwork are seen amongst other eastern and
        central European cultures.</dd>
