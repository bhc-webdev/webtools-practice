				<figcaption>Easter Bunny with cart</figcaption>
				<p>This is the Easter Bunny pushing a garden cart. I would love to see his garden. How does he grow all
					those eggs to share every year? Must be a lot of work. Maybe he can get the Little Red Hen to help
					him? So cute!</p>

				<figcaption>Easter Bunny with pile of eggs</figcaption>
				<p>This is the Easter Bunny managing his pile of eggs. That is a big pile of eggs! I think he must have
					gone hunting before the kids got there. Reminds me of a leprechaun hoarding his crock of gold.</p>

				<figcaption>Easter Bunny in car</figcaption>
				<p>This is the Easter Bunny driving in a car. I think he looks more like a donkey than a bunny to me. I
					guess they even let the magical Easter Bunny get a driver's license now?</p>

				<figcaption>Easter Bunny holding eggs</figcaption>
				<p>This Easter Bunny is holding a big load of eggs. He appears to be holding as many eggs as he can.
					Anymore and he will likely fall over backwards!</p>

				<p>This Easter Bunny is happy just hopping along. He's got his basket and a lot of spirit. Where are
					those kids?!? We need to give out these eggs!</p>

				<figcaption>Easter Bunny painting eggs</figcaption>
				<p>This is the Easter Bunny painting his eggs for the kids. What an artist this Easter Bunny is! How
					does he come up with all these variations and designs?</p>
